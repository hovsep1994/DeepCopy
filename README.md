# Deep Copy Utility

A flexible and extensible **Deep Copy Utility** for Java that allows deep cloning of objects, collections, and maps â€”
including support for complex object graphs, cyclic references, and immutable types.

---

## Features

- **Deep copy for custom classes, collections, and maps**
- Handles **cyclic references** using identity maps
- Supports deep copying of **arrays**, **lists**, **sets**, and **maps**
- Optimized for **immutable types** (e.g., `String`, `Integer`, `BigDecimal`)
- Fallback to **ReflectionFactory instantiation** for classes without no-arg constructors

## Technologies

- **Java 23+**
- **Maven** (for build and dependency management)
- **JUnit** *(for unit testing)*
